<h2>Problem 1 - Mastermind</h2>
<p>The Game of Master Mind is played as follows:<br>
The computer has four slots containing balls that are red (R), yellow (Y), green (G) or blue (B). For example, the computer might have RGGB (e g , Slot #1 is red, Slots #2 and #3 are green, Slot #4 is blue).<br>
You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. You might, for example, guess YRGB.<br>
When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a “hit”. If you guess a color that exists but is in the wrong slot, you get a “pseudo-hit”. For example, the guess YRGB has 2 hits and one pseudo hit<br>
For each guess, you are told the number of hits and pseudo-hits.<br>
Write a method that, given a guess and a solution, returns the number of hits and pseudo hits.</p>
